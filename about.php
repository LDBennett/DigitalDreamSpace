          <h2>What is Digital Dream Space?</h2>
          <p>Digital Dream Space is a project that takes dream posts from Reddit and 
            displays them in a "dream-like" fashion.
          </p>
          <p>I wanted the titles and content(Desktop-only) to shake to show the instability of dreams. Think
            about how easy it is to forget a dream you just woke up from. Or even
            while you are in the dream, things are not always stable. I wanted to show
            this through the shaking and the scattering of the title when it is clicked on.<br/>
            I also wanted to show the randomness of dreams. The website will most likely
            never be the EXACT same. From the randomly picked posts pulled from the Dreams Subreddit
            to the random angle position of each dream title, all of these things are
            randomized.
          </p>
          <p>In the Desktop Version, the zoomable UI gives the sense that there
            are no limits. That's why this project virtually has
            no lines at all in it.<br/>
            In addition, it's also a limitation I found using Zoomooz.js. Although
            I feel as if it does help with the boundlessness of the site.
          </p>
